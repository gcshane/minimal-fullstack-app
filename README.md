# Minimal Fullstack Application~

This application serves as a proof-of-concept to develop a full-stack application with **minimal tools**. A single **Python** file with **Streamlit** generates the user interface that handles user inputs and also display data retrieved from a **MongoDB** database. The application is also deployed to **Heroku** for a real user.
